Partial paralization can be a consequence of various health disorders. To regain motoric and cognitive movement control patients need to exercise their impaired body parts. CUBE wants to offer an interactive experience for such trainings.
CUBE offers a variety of interaction affordances. These are used to make the patient train their impaired body parts. Light and vibration feedback can be used to signalize status and/or give instructions to the patient. Through changeable game or exercise programs CUBE can be used in a lot of different ways for rehabilitation.
